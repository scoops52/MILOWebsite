          </h2>
          <p className="text-xl text-white font-lato">
            Every time you complete a workout, all you need to do is input how you felt during the workout, which we call <span className="text-lightBlue">Effort Level</span>, and note the start and end times of your workout. MILO&apos;s intelligent algorithm takes care of the rest, providing you with personalized insights and recommendations to help you achieve your fitness goals.

            MILO can tell all that just from my Effort Level and Workout Duration?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-xl text-white font-lato">
          Absolutely! MILO&apos;s ability to derive meaningful insights from your Effort Level and workout duration is firmly grounded in sports science. Research has demonstrated the scientific validity of Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) as a robust and intuitive measure of exercise intensity. By incorporating your Effort Level, MILO taps into your body's internal cues, providing a holistic view of how each workout is impacting your body. When combined with workout duration, MILO creates a comprehensive training load calculation that aligns with established principles of exercise physiology. This amalgamation of RPE and duration forms the bedrock of MILO&apos;s accurate and personalized fitness assessments, paving the way for a smarter, more effective fitness journey.

            How is this different from using a Fitness Wearable?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-xl text-white font-lato">
          While fitness wearables offer valuable data, MILO stands apart with its unique focus on your individual perception of effort.  External metrics such as heart rate, hrv, and step count can be very insightful. However, MILO aims to approach fitness from a global perspective, tapping in to your own internal feedback system. This personalized approach captures the nuances of your workout intensity, accounting for factors such as fatigue, motivation, and additional stressors.
